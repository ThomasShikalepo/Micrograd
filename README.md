# Micrograd Implementation and Development

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a lightweight **automatic differentiation (autodiff)** engine, inspired by [Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd). The engine simulates neural network operations by building a custom computational graph, handling forward and backward propagation, and implementing optimization techniques like gradient descent.

---

## Features

- **Autodiff Engine**: Custom implementation supporting forward and backward propagation for gradient-based learning.
- **Neural Network Foundation**: Core neural network operations, including gradient descent and backpropagation.
- **Optimized Computation**: Uses Python with NumPy for efficient computation and Matplotlib for visualizations.
- **Visualization**: Leverages Graphviz to visualize the computational graph and network structure.

## Dependencies

To run the project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Graphviz

## How It Works

1. **Forward Propagation**: Input data is passed through the network layers, and outputs are computed based on the network's weights and activations.
2. **Backward Propagation**: The engine calculates gradients for each layer using the chain rule after computing the output, updating weights for optimization.
3. **Optimization**: Gradient descent or other algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and improve model performance.
